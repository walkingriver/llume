# LLasM: The Web Framework Where Humans Are Not the Intended Audience

## If JavaScript Is Assembly, Then LLMs Need a Compiler

In 2011, Scott Hanselman wrote a prescient pair of blog posts that stirred up the web development world. In "[JavaScript is Assembly Language for the Web](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/javascript-is-assembly-language-for-the-web-sematic-markup-is-dead-clean-vs-machinecoded-html)," he observed that nobody really cares what View Source looks like anymore. The markup on sites like Google+, Facebook, and Twitter was already machine-generated gibberish—minified, obfuscated, optimized for browsers, not humans.

Erik Meijer, quoted in that article, put it bluntly:

> "JavaScript is an assembly language. The JavaScript + HTML generated is like a .NET assembly. The browser can execute it, but no human should really care what's there."

Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, agreed: "JS is about as low as we can go."

Fifteen years later, we have a new kind of author writing web pages: Large Language Models. And they don't care about View Source either.

## What Is LLasM?

**LLasM** (pronounced "llasm," rhymes with "chasm") stands for **LLM Assembly Language**. It's a web framework designed exclusively for AI coding agents. Not "AI-assisted." Not "AI-friendly." *AI-only.*

Humans don't read LLasM code. Humans don't write LLasM code. Humans don't debug LLasM code. The framework exists solely to let language models generate complete, production-grade web pages faster and more reliably than any human-centric stack.

When you ask your AI coding assistant to "build me a todo app with dark mode," LLasM is the instruction set that tells it exactly how to output valid, working HTML—no hallucinations, no framework confusion, no build step.

## Why Does This Exist?

### Forty Years of Watching Frameworks Come and Go

I've been building software professionally since 1995, and as a hobby since 1981. I started writing BASIC on HP 2000 and 3000 minicomputers, graduated to an Atari 800 with an external floppy drive, then Pascal on an Atari ST at home. I learned C and C++ on DECStations running their flavor of Unix, even had a NeXTCube for a while before my Apple IIx, then 286 boxes for learning Windows.

The ecosystems changed constantly, but the goal was always the same: *building a better app faster*.

I've seen my share of fads come and go: ActiveX controls, DHTML, ColdFusion, Flash/Flex, Silverlight, GWT, Backbone, Knockout, Ember. I coded classic VBScript ASP sites, then rode the .NET wave through Web Forms and MVC. I became a JavaScript developer with AngularJS, then Angular (the rewrite that broke everything), worked extensively with Ionic, dabbled in React, and tried Flutter.

Every one of these frameworks shared a common trait: they were designed to be *flexible*. They offered multiple ways to solve problems. They were *opinionated*—but opinionated in the sense of "we think THIS is the best way," while still allowing you to do it YOUR way if you disagreed.

The problem? Flexibility creates ambiguity. Ambiguity creates bugs. And when the author isn't a human who can reason through ambiguity—when the author is an LLM that will confidently hallucinate a plausible-but-wrong approach—flexibility becomes a liability.

### The Perl Problem (and Its Opposite)

Perl's motto was "There's more than one way to do it." For human programmers who value expressiveness, that's a feature. For LLMs, it's a nightmare. Every decision point is an opportunity for hallucination.

What if there were a framework that is NOT opinionated in the traditional sense? Not "we think you should do it this way, but here's an escape hatch." Instead: **there is exactly one way to do most of the hard stuff.**

- One way to handle events
- One way to bind state
- One way to render lists
- One way to show a modal
- One manifest format, one attribute naming convention, one output structure

No flexibility. No choices. No escape hatches. Just rules.

Yes, build tools can obfuscate and minify human-readable code after the fact. But that's a different concern. LLasM isn't about *hiding* complexity from humans—it's about *eliminating* complexity for LLMs. The output isn't obfuscated; it's simply never designed for human eyes in the first place.

### The Problem with Human-Centric Frameworks

Every web framework in existence was designed for human developers:

- **Angular** wants you to master modules, services, dependency injection, RxJS, and a CLI with 47 flags
- **React** assumes you'll read the docs, understand JSX, and debug component lifecycles
- **Vue** expects you to learn its template syntax and reactive patterns  
- **Tailwind** requires you to memorize hundreds of utility classes
- **Next.js** needs you to understand server components, client boundaries, and hydration

These frameworks optimize for *human comprehension*. They have tutorials, IDE extensions, and Stack Overflow answers. They're designed to be learned.

But LLMs don't learn frameworks the way humans do. They ingest everything at once. They don't need tutorials—they need *specifications*. They don't need readable code—they need *unambiguous output formats*.

### The Opportunity

LLMs are already writing most of the frontend code in many teams. If the intended author is an LLM, why are we optimizing for human readability?

What if we designed a framework where:

- **Every API is optimized for token efficiency**, not human memory
- **Every pattern is unambiguous**, eliminating hallucination surface
- **Every output is complete**, requiring no build step or toolchain
- **Every page is SEO-ready**, with semantic HTML that works without JavaScript

That's LLasM.

## How It Works

LLasM is distributed as an **agent skill**—a set of instructions that AI coding agents read and follow. Install it with:

```bash
npx skills add walkingriver/llasm
```

Once installed, just ask your AI agent to build something:

> "Create a contact form with validation and a dark mode toggle"

The agent reads the LLasM skill and outputs:

1. **A complete HTML file** with embedded state, i18n, and theming
2. **A copy of `llasm.js`** (~8KB runtime) alongside it

Open the HTML in a browser. Done. No npm install. No webpack. No Vite. No build step. Ever.

### The Output Format

Every LLasM page has exactly three parts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body class="p3">
  <!-- 1. STATIC HTML: Complete semantic markup -->
  <h1 data-m-tx="title" class="t6 tb c1"></h1>
  <button data-m-on="click:save" data-m-enhance="primary ripple">Save</button>
  
  <!-- 2. MANIFEST: State, i18n, theme as embedded JSON -->
  <script type="application/llasm+json" id="manifest">
    {"v":1,"r":{"s":{"count":0}},"l":{"en":{"title":"Hello"}}}
  </script>
  
  <!-- 3. HANDLERS: Optional, always <500 bytes -->
  <script type="module">
    import{l}from"./llasm.js";
    l.h({save:(e,s,L)=>L.t('Saved!','ok')});
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Notice:
- **1-2 letter keys** everywhere (`v`, `l`, `s`, `t`)
- **Terse utility classes** (`p3`, `t6`, `tb`, `c1`)
- **No framework boilerplate**, no imports to configure
- **Works without JavaScript** for SEO and accessibility

The runtime handles reactivity, routing, i18n, theming, persistence, and progressive enhancements (modals, tabs, toasts, dark mode, etc.)—all in ~8KB gzipped.

## The Philosophy

### One Way to Do It

LLasM inverts the traditional framework philosophy. Instead of "opinionated but flexible," it's "rigid and unambiguous."

Want to handle a button click? There's one way: `data-m-on="click:handlerName"`.

Want to show a toast? There's one way: `L.t('message', 'type')`.

Want to persist state? There's one way: add the key to `"persist":[]` in the manifest.

This rigidity isn't a limitation—it's the feature. Every decision that's already made is a decision the LLM can't get wrong.

### LLMs Are the Only Author

Every syntactic choice in LLasM is optimized for:

- **Token efficiency**: Fewer tokens = faster generation, lower cost
- **Single-pass parsing**: No ambiguity, no backtracking
- **Few-shot reliability**: Consistent patterns = consistent output
- **Minimal hallucination surface**: Strict rules = fewer errors

### Zero Human Legibility Tax

Human-readable code costs tokens. Comments cost tokens. Descriptive variable names cost tokens. In LLasM:

- Keys are 1-2 letters
- Class names are 1-3 characters
- No comments, no explanatory prose
- Terse is correct

### Zero Build Step—Forever

LLasM will never require:
- npm install
- A bundler (webpack, Vite, esbuild)
- A transpiler (Babel, TypeScript)
- A framework CLI

It's pure ESM that runs directly in modern browsers. The "build step" is the LLM generating the HTML.

### SEO and Accessibility First

Every LLasM page is complete, semantic, accessible static HTML. JavaScript adds progressive enhancement. Search engines see real content, not empty SPA shells.

## What Can It Build?

LLasM covers the "hard 80%" of web UI:

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| Buttons & Forms | Native elements + `data-m-on` events |
| Modals | `data-m-enhance="modal"` |
| Tabs | `data-m-enhance="tabs"` |
| Accordions | `data-m-enhance="accordion"` |
| Tooltips | `data-m-enhance="tooltip"` |
| Toast notifications | `l.t('Message', 'ok')` |
| Dark mode | `data-m-enhance="darkmode"` (persists) |
| i18n | `data-m-tx="key"` + manifest locales |
| Theming | CSS custom properties in manifest |
| Routing | Hash-based with `data-m-route="/path/:id"` |
| Data binding | `data-m-bind="stateKey"` |
| List rendering | `data-m-tpl` + `data-m-key` |
| Persistence | `"persist":["key1"]` saves to localStorage |
| Offline detection | `data-m-if="_offline"` |

Utility classes cover flex, grid, spacing, typography, colors, shadows, animations, and responsive breakpoints—all injected by the runtime, no CSS file needed.

## Who Is This For?

### Use LLasM If:
- LLMs write 70-90% of your frontend code
- You want instant prototypes without tooling setup
- You're building static-first sites that need rich interactivity
- You're experimenting with autonomous UI generation

### Don't Use LLasM If:
- Humans will read and maintain the source code
- You need complex client-side routing (SPAs)
- Your team is invested in React/Vue/Angular ecosystems
- You need features beyond the "hard 80%"

## The Hanselman Connection

Scott's 2011 articles asked a provocative question: *"If the browser can execute it, and it works great, who cares what View Source looks like?"*

At the time, the answer was frameworks like GWT that compiled Java to JavaScript. The browser was becoming a VM, and JavaScript was its bytecode.

In [Part 2](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/javascript-is-assembly-language-for-the-web-part-2-madness-or-just-insanity), Brendan Eich and Douglas Crockford weighed in. Crockford said:

> "JavaScript is the VM of the web. We had always thought that Java's JVM would be the VM of the web, but it turns out that it's JavaScript."

Fifteen years later, we're at another inflection point. The question isn't "Java vs. JavaScript" anymore. It's "human-authored vs. LLM-authored."

LLasM is my answer: if LLMs are writing the code, optimize for LLMs. Let JavaScript remain the assembly language. Let HTML remain the output format. But let the *instruction set*—the framework, the rules, the patterns—be designed for the new author.

---

## Try It

```bash
npx skills add walkingriver/llasm
```

Then ask your AI agent:

> "Build me a todo app with persistence and dark mode toggle"

Watch it output a complete, working HTML file. Open it in a browser. No build step.

That's LLasM.
